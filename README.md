Flowgger is a fast, simple and lightweight data collector written in Rust.

It reads log entries over a given protocol, extracts them, decodes them using a
given format, re-encodes them into a different format, and asynchronously pushes
the result into a remote data store.

Flowgger is designed to be:
- Paranoid: it carefully validates input data to prevent injection of
malformed/incomplete records down the chain.
- Safe: written in Rust, without any `unsafe` code.
- Fast: even though messages are systematically parsed and validated, Flowgger
is orders of magnitude faster than Logstash and Fluentd.
- Standalone: it comes as a single executable file, and doesn't require a JVM.

Flowgger supports common input types: stdin, UDP, TCP, TLS and Redis,
as well as multiple input formats: JSON (GELF), LTSV, Cap'n Proto and
RFC5424. Normalized messages can be sent to Kafka, Graylog, to downstream
Flowgger servers, or to other log collectors for further processing.
